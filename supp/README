To create the EPS files from the PNG files do something like this:
1)
pngtopnm xxx.png > xxx.pnm
2)
pnmtops -noturn -nocenter xxx.pnm > xxx.ps
3)
ps2eps xxx.ps

When trying to skip steps 1 & 2 above and use the PS generated from the
Gdocs export to PDF this would cause the image to be rotated and truncated
in the doxygen generated PDF.
