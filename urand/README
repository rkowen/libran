This urand directory is specialized to creating a sequential congruential
uniform pseudo-random number generator based on Fortran77 code originally
given by D.E. Knuth (1969) and then published by G.E. Forsysth,
M.A. Malcolm, and C.B. Moler (1977); and converted to C with f2c.

The configure script will run several tests and set certain options based
on optimizing certain base operations.
